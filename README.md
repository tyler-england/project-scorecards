# project-scorecards
project status snapshot &amp; trend graphing

This is an Excel file which is reviewed each week to assess the progress of open projects. Each sheet has the same fields, but each sheet relates to a different project. Data sources include the company database (accessed through SQL), a separate manual input sheet (updated by supervisors), and a separate document tracker.

Items shown:

- General info (customer/location/serial number/order number/etc)

- Current completion percentage for Mech/Elec Engineering, Software, and Assembly

- Project trend (margin change as compared to the last update)

- Hours (amount already used vs. amount predicted to still be required) for Engineering and Assembly

- Comparison between what was sold and what is predicted to happen (material, hours, overall margin)

- The last 20 parts expected to arrive for this project (and their due dates)

- The documents related to this project, and each of their statuses

- Payment terms for the project

- "Material variance," a manual field which is updated when a new known cost will impact the margin but hasn't yet been incorporated into the database
